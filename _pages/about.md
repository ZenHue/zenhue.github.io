Hi! I'm Zehua Wang, an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Physics and Computer Science at MIT (expected May 2028). I'm currently completing my freshman year at Tsinghua University's Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) before transferring to MIT.

## Academic Background

My academic journey has been rooted in both theoretical physics and computational research. I achieved **1st place in the theoretical round** at the 54th International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) and earned gold medals at multiple prestigious competitions, including 3rd place globally at the Romanian Master of Physics.

At Tsinghua, I've maintained high-level academic performance (GPA: 3.95/4.00) while diving deep into research areas including machine learning, computer vision, and robotics.

## Research & Projects

I'm passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, and physics. During my freshman year, I worked as an undergraduate researcher on learning-based control systems under Prof. Huazhe Xu, investigating novel frameworks for robot manipulation.

Some of my recent projects include:
- **Enhanced Diffusion Models** using RL and adversarial rewards (21.7% FID improvement)
- **CLEVAM-DM** for consistent local video editing with diffusion models  

## Beyond Academics

Outside of my studies, I maintain an active lifestyle and enjoy a variety of sports. Basketball is a particular passion; I had the privilege of leading the IIIS basketball team as an undergraduate during my freshman year. I've also been skiing for over a decade and enjoy playing soccer, volleyball, table tennis, swimming, hiking, etc. In my spare time, I love to unwind by listening to music and sometimes singing them.
